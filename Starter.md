# Guided Project: PhotoBloom

This guided project has two parts.

- In the first part you will focus on learning how to call Java methods and you will build an early version of a Photo Album app.
- In the second part you will focus on loading data of photos in a more complete object-oriented version of the Photo Album app.

*Note: If you would like to save the work done on this project, you will need to create a free account on the OpenProcessing website.**
